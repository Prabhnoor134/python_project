Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents.
Private Key: The same key (secret key) is used for encryption and decryption. In this key is symmetric because the only key is copy or share by another party to decrypt the cipher text.
Public Key: Two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption. One key (public key) is used for encrypt the plain text to convert it into cipher text and another key (private key) is used by receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message.
Discrete Logarithm are defined as if u is a primitive root modulo m, then for any unit a there is a k such that a ≡ uk mod m.
This project can be useful for a person who is in need of secure transportation for his/her data.
